### Contributing
In order to contribute to the project, clone the repo onto your local machine, and open the project with Godot 4.1.x.

Use your favorite code editor to make changes, and godot to make new nodes/test the game. 

Some contribution standards to try and adhere to:
- UpperCase for Scene and Script files.
- camelCase for folder names and paths.
- UpperCase for all class names.
- If you will be making potentially breaking changes, please create a new branch off of `dev`` in order to test/share them with others!
